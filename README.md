# README: AIC Model Selection in R

## Understand and Apply AIC Model Selection

Are you ready to deepen your skills in linear modeling and learn how to refine models with precision? This tutorial focuses on the **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)** and its applications in model selection, specifically tailored for ecological and environmental datasets.

Here's what you'll learn:

1. Why and when AIC model selection is important.
2. How to evaluate models using stepwise selection metrics.
3. Practical use of the `drop1()` function for assessing variable importance.
4. Automation of model refinement with the `step()` function.
5. Application of AIC concepts to real-world problems in ecology and environmental science.

We’ll work through worked examples using datasets typical in ecological research, equipping you with the tools to handle large, complex datasets confidently.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial is ideal for those with basic to intermediate knowledge of statistical analysis, particularly linear modeling. To get the most out of this session, you should be familiar with:

- The basics of **linear models** using the `lm()` function in R.
- Understanding the **summary output** of models, including key metrics like \(R^2\) and Residual Standard Error (RSE).

If you’re new to linear models or need a refresher, we recommend the following tutorials on the Coding Club website:  
- [From Distributions to Linear Models](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/modelling/)  
- [Introduction to Model Design](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/model-design/)

This tutorial builds on those foundational skills, guiding you through the use of AIC for selecting the best linear models.
